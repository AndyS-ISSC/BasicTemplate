Members of Indivisible SF are defined by our action and find solidarity in our shared opposition to Trump and Trumpism. Each of us explicitly reserves our individual stances on specific issues for other forums as we believe resisting Trump is more important than any single issue. We adhere to a Code of Conduct that welcomes and respects everybody. 

Members of Indivisible SF come from all kinds of backgrounds and political persuasions. Some of us are first-time activists and other have been at this for decades. We are citizens and noncitizens. Most importantly, we are all patriots that want the best for our country and are willing to work for it.

**All are welcome.**

**What Actions Do We Take?**

​We influence our Members of Congress (MoCs) by expressing our views in four ways:

1. Meeting with our MoCs and their staffs. Indivisible SF has a standing monthly meeting with Senator Feinstein and will soon have the same with Senator Harris and Representatives Pelosi and Speier.
2. Attending MoC-sponsored events, especially town halls.
3. Mass calling. Each week, Indivisible SF members make hundreds of calls to our MoCs.
4. Media. Indivisible SF is a fast-growing chapter of the burgeoning Indivisible movement. The media is taking notice and we intend to use that attention to influence our MoCs and public policy. ​
