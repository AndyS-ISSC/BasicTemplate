# An Indivisible website in a box

Indivisible Template is an easy to use website generator specifically built for Indivisible chapters. It was created by
[Sahadeva Hammari](http://sahadeva.com).

**What Features does it look like?**

See an example at [IndivisibleTemplate.github.io](http://IndivisibleTemplate.github.io).

**What Features does it have?**

*   It's free
*   It's fast
*   It's easy to use
*   It's open source
*   It supports blogging, creating custom pages, media galleries, speed dialing, and much more.

**How does it work?**

The Indivisible Template uses GitHub to host your website and SiteLeaf as a CMS. This are both free to use and you don't have to worry about traffic limits, server setup, or hosting costs. SiteLeaf has additional paid features that may be useful if you have a large chapter, but those features are not required to use the template.


**I'm a nerd: Give me the technical details.**

The Indivisible Template runs on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). The Indivisible Template is essentially a Jekyll theme with good defaults out of the box.

[Siteleaf](https://www.siteleaf.com/) is a CMS that interacts with GitHub out of the box.


**What Indivisible chapters use it?**



# How to I set up my site?

1.  Purchase a domain name for your chapter if you don't already have one. I recommend using [Google Domains](https://domains.google/).
1.  Create a free GitHub account at [Github.com](https://github.com/). I recommend you pick a username that matches your Indivisible chapter name, e.g. *IndivisibleSF*.
1.  Go to [https://github.com/IndivisibleTemplate/IndivisibleTemplate.github.io](https://github.com/IndivisibleTemplate/IndivisibleTemplate.github.io) in your browser
1.  Click the *Fork* button in the top right of the page. This will create your own copy of the template that will power your new website.
1.  Rename your copy of the template with your GitHub username by clicking the *Settings* button on your new template's page.
1.  Got to [siteleaf.com](https://www.siteleaf.com/) and create a free account.
1.  Connect your new GitHub template to Siteleaf



# Important considerations

1. All the information on your website will be public to everyone on the web. There is no way to hide information from someone who is actively searching for it.
