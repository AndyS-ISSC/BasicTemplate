# An Indivisible Website In a Box

Indivisible Template is an easy to use website generator specifically built for Indivisible chapters. It was created by
[Sahadeva Hammari](http://sahadeva.com).

**What does it look like?**

See an example at [IndivisibleTemplate.github.io](http://IndivisibleTemplate.github.io).

**What Features does it have?**

*   It's free
*   It's fast
*   It's easy to use and set up
*   It's open source
*   No traffic limits or servers to maintain
*   It supports blogging, creating custom pages, media galleries, speed dialing, and much more.

**How does it work?**

The Indivisible Template uses GitHub to host your website and [siteleaf.com](https://www.siteleaf.com/) as a CMS (content management system). This are both free to use and you don't have to worry about traffic limits, server setup, or hosting costs. SiteLeaf has additional paid features that may be useful if you have a large chapter, but those features are not required to use the template.


**I'm a nerd: Give me the technical details.**

The Indivisible Template runs on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). The Indivisible Template is essentially a Jekyll theme with good defaults out of the box.

[Siteleaf](https://www.siteleaf.com/) is a CMS that interacts with GitHub out of the box.

# How to I set up my site?

**Get a domain**

1.  Purchase a domain name for your chapter if you don't already have one. I recommend using [Google Domains](https://domains.google/).
1.  Follow your domain registrar's instructions to create two `A` records that point your custom domain to the following IP addresses. This will connect your domain to your new Indivisible Template website.
> 192.30.252.153
> 192.30.252.154

**Set up your website**

1.  Create a free GitHub account at [Github.com](https://github.com/). I recommend you pick a username that matches your Indivisible chapter name, e.g. *IndivisibleSF*.
1.  Go to [https://github.com/IndivisibleTemplate/IndivisibleTemplate.github.io](https://github.com/IndivisibleTemplate/IndivisibleTemplate.github.io) in your browser
1.  Click the *Fork* button in the top right of the page. This will create your own copy of the template that will power your new website.
1.  Rename your copy of the template with your GitHub username by clicking the *Settings* button on your new template's page.
1.  Enter your domain name into the settings page so that your domain will point to your new Indivisible Template.

**Connect the Siteleaf CMS to your website**

1.  Got to [siteleaf.com](https://www.siteleaf.com/) and create a free account.
1.  Go to [manage.siteleaf.com/sites](https://manage.siteleaf.com/sites) and click `Create new site`.
1.  In the right hand column click the `Connect existing repo` button.
1.  Select `Public repo`
1.  In the *Repo Name* field, type in your GitHub username and your Indivisible Template name should appear in an autosuggest field. Click it to connect Siteleaf to your GitHub account so that you can use Siteleaf to edit your new template.
1.  Browse around your Siteleaf account and start editing your website


**How to use the Siteleaf CMS**

Settings: This is where you change the name of your site, your contact email address, your member count, your homepage header photo, and more.

Posts: This is where you create new blog posts, including new event posts, actions posts, and regular blog posts.

How to create action posts: To create an action item simply create a blog post and add the category `action` to it. That will pull in your representatives contact info, an optional call script, and highlight the post in red.

How to create event posts: To create an event post, simply add the category `event` to your post.
